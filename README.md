The app features geolocalization to display the current location of the user if they are using the gps functionality, or show the selected region.

If the user has selected a specific region and they wish to see the current weather forecast for it, they can save it for faster access to it.

I have also implemented a world map in which users can drop a pin on whichever corner of the Earth they wish and it will show the closest weather for that location.
